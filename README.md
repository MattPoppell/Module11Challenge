# Module 11 Challenge

## Description
This module's challenge required the finishing of a note-taking application.  Starter code was provided in the curriculum for the front-end.  This application allows a user to create notes and save them in the browser.   

## Usage
Upon loading the user is presented with a landing page containg a button.  When the button is clicked, the user is presented with a window containg fields for the title and text of a note.  When a note is crweated, the user is presented with an icon of a floppy disk in the upper right-hand corner.  Clicking this icon saves the note and moves it to the left side of the page.  Users can create a new noe by clicking the "New Note" button in the upper right-hand corner.  Users can also delete notes by clicking the trashcan icon.

## Installation
This application requires no installation.  Application is ready when page loads.

## Live Link
Due to payment issues through my student account on Heroku, this application is not currently deployed live.
